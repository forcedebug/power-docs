# Sending a transaction to another account

To send a transaction within the system you need to pay commission. That is why, you need to have sufficient amount of tokens to send the transaction. The code `console.log('accountData',accountData)` from the `showAccountInfo.js` example above outputs the account data. The `amount` field in the output will also display the tokens assigned to the account.

   :::warning

   The account address

   ```javascript
   let to='AA100001733086413603';
   ```

   specified in `sendTransferTx.js` is an example address. Please, replace it with your actual destination address.
