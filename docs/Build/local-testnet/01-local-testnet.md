# Local testnet

The local testnet could be a good idea if you need to:

- test how the network works,
- run autotests for your DApps, or
- customize your node to satisfy your needs.

Before using the local testnet, you need to build and start the node

- from [source code](../../Maintain/build-and-start-a-node/06-startingTpNode_source.md), 
- from [Docker image](../../Maintain/build-and-start-a-node/05-startingTpNode_docker.md), or
- using [`docker-compose`](../../Maintain/build-and-start-a-node/07-startingTpNode_docker_compose.md).

Use our [guide](../../Maintain/02-testnet-start.md) to start your local testnet.
